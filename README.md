# Ontologies-knora

Note: other relevant information is in the "Ontologies" repository.

This library of ontologies is maintained for the platform [Knora](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora) of the [Digital Humanities Lab Basel](https://github.com/dhlab-basel), requiring application-specific semantics, to which the ontologies are reduced and adapted.

To be used with the latest stable release in the ["suite-quickstart" repository](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart) as described in the [README](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart/blob/master/README.md).  
Note: via the script [importLatestOntology.sh](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart/tree/master/importLatestOntologyFromGithub) the files in this repository are copied into Knora.
