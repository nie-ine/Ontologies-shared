# Ontologies-shared

Currently a test environment for the project-independent NIE-ontologies being made 'shared' in the application [Knora](https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora) of the [Digital Humanities Lab](https://github.com/dhlab-basel).
To be used with the latest stable release in the [suite-quickstart repository](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart) as described in the [README](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart/blob/master/README.md).
Note: via the script [importLatestOntology.sh](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart/tree/master/importLatestOntologyFromGithub) the files in this repository are copied into Knora.
