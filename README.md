# Ontologies-knora

Note: other relevant information is in the [Ontologies](https://github.com/nie-ine/Ontologies) repository.

Until 28 November 2019 this library of ontologies was maintained for the [Knora server application](https://www.knora.org/) (developed by the [Digital Humanities Lab (DHL)](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/en/home/) at the University of Basel and the [Data and Service Center for humanities (DaSCH)](https://dasch.swiss/)) requiring application-specific semantics, to which the domain ontologies are reduced and adapted.

To be used with the latest stable release in the [suite-quickstart](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart) repository as described in the [README](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart/blob/master/README.md).  
Note: via the script [importLatestOntology.sh](https://github.com/nie-ine/suite-quickstart/tree/master/importLatestOntologyFromGithub) the files in this repository are copied into Knora.
